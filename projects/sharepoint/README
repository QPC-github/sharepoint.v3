Welcome to the Google Search Appliance Connector for SharePoint

The Google Search Appliance Connector framework enables Google search
appliances to search and serve documents stored in non-Web
repositories, such as enterprise content management systems. An
enterprise content management (ECM) system provides a central
repository for large numbers of documents.

The Connector for SharePoint provides access to documents and document
metadata stored in the SharePoint Server developed by the Microsoft
Corporation.

The connector communicates with the SharePoint Server using the
SharePoint Web services.

This source code repository is for version 3 of the connector. For
information about the latest version of the Connector for SharePoint,
